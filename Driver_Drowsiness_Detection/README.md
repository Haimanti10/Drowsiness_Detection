# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
Driver drowsiness detection is a project built using NumPy, Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.
<h3>Logic of project</h3>
The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library.
The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which 
we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed. The drowsiness detection algorithm assigns one of three labels to the user's state: "active," "drowsy," or "sleeping."</br></br>
